\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the arena, in a table close to the cupboard.
	\item \textbf{Table:} Chairs may be placed around the table and won't be removed.
	\item \textbf{Cupboard:} The cupboard doors and drawers are initially closed.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} The objects used in this test can be found in the cupboard, not in their predefined locations.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care. It must be clear that the robot is trying to place the object, not throwing or dropping it.

	\item \textbf{Cupboard drawers:} The team decides whether the objects are inside one of the cupboard drawers (and which) or placed on the cupboard.
	When no drawers are available, objects can be placed inside the cupboard. The cupboard door is used instead.
