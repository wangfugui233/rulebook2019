% \subsection{Focus}
% This test focuses on object perception, manipulation, and planning.

\subsection{Main Goal}
All the tableware and cutlery is inside the dishwasher.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the dishwasher door (300pts)
	\item Pulling out the dishwasher racks (300pts)
	\item Placing the Cascade Pod inside the dishwasher (300pts)
	\item Leaving the arena (100pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the arena. A dining table is located close to the dishwasher.
	\item \textbf{Tray:} A plastic tray is located either on top of the dishwasher, or onto one of its racks. The tray may have tableware and cutlery placed inside already.
	\item \textbf{Table setting:} The table has a total of 6 objects disposed in a typical setting for a meal for one person
	Distribution is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textit{Silverware}: Any two objects (fork, knife, spoon).
		\item\textit{Tableware}: Any three objects, excluding silverware. At least one must be a dish.
		\item\textit{Cascade Pod}: One Cascade Pod.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care. It must be clear that the robot is trying to place the object, not throwing or dropping it.

	\item \textbf{Dishwasher:} The team decides whether the robot will place the objects in the dishwasher's rack or in the official tray.

	\item \textbf{Dishwasher door:} The dishwasher door is open and with the racks pulled out by default.
	The team leader can, however, request the diswasher to be closed and score additional points for opening it. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state it and request the referee to open it.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Place the table setting.
	\item Place the tray on the dishwasher or onto the rack, as requested by the team.
\end{itemize}
