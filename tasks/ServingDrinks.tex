\section{Serving Drinks [Party Host]}
The robot has to take orders and deliver drinks.

% \subsection{Focus}

% This test focuses on human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection{Main Goal}
All people in the party must have a drink of their choice.
The robot must find all 3 people who has no drink and bring them the one of their choice.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 750pts (250pts per delivered drink).

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Preemptively informing a guest that the ordered drink is not available (250pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place in the living room.
	Initially there is one person sitting here whom the robot already knows.
	This person is referred as \emph{default guest}.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.

	\item \textbf{Guests:} There are at least 5 guests in the living room, two standing and three sitting.
	Each guest has assigned a predefined name and has either a drink or a drink request (choice and alternative).

	\item \textbf{Bar:} The bar can be any flat surface where objects can be placed, in any other room but the living room.
	All available beverages are on top of the bar.
	One of the drink requests is not available.
	
	\item \textbf{Bartender:} The Bartender may be standing either behind the bar or next to it, depending on the arena setup.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring.
	Robot score per correct delivered drink.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Actively placing order:} Approaching to the robot to place an order causes a reduction of 40\% in scoring for that particular guest.

		\item \textbf{Calling to place order:} Calling (either by shouting or waving) to the robot to place an order causes a reduction of 20\% in scoring for that particular guest.

		\item \textbf{Revealing unavailable drink:} Telling the robot which drink is unavailable causes a reduction of 40\% in scoring for that particular guest.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Delivering drinks:} When delivering a drink, the robot must greet the guest by stating her name and remembering the chosen drink.
	The robot may either hand-over drinks or have attached a tray.
	When a tray is used, the robot must be sure that the guest is taking the correct drink (guests may try to take the wrong one).

	\item \textbf{Misunderstood names:} If the robot misunderstands the name, the understood (wrong) name is used in the remainder of this test.

	\item \textbf{Changing places:} After giving the order (when the robot is not in the living room), the referees may re-arrange the people.

	\item \textbf{Empty arena:} For this task only the robot, the guests, and the Bartender are allowed to be in the arena.
\end{enumerate}
