\section{Receptionist [Party Host]}

The robot has to allocate and introduce guests in a party.

% \subsection{Focus}
% This test focuses on human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection{Main Goal}
The robot has to take two arriving guests to the living room, introducing them to each other, and offering the just-arrived guest an unoccupied place to sit.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts (250pts per guest).

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the entrance door to a guest (200pts each, max 400pts)
	\item Sitting the female guest next to a male guest (100pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place in the living room.
	Initially there is one person sitting here whom the robot already knows.
	This person is referred as \emph{default guest}.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.

	\item \textbf{Guests:} Each guest has assigned a predefined name and a favorite drink.
	At least one guest is female.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest.

	\item \textbf{Repeating names:} The robot may ask to repeat the name if it has not understood it.
	
	\item \textbf{Misunderstood names:} If the robot misunderstands the name, the understood (wrong) name is used in the remainder of this test.
	A score reduction of 20\%  for that particular guest applies.
	
	\item \textbf{Knowing guests:} When a guest arrives, the robot must ask that person her name and favorite drink.

	\item \textbf{Introducing guests:} When introducing guests, the robot must point at the person who is being introduced, stating her name and favorite drink.

	\item \textbf{Sitting people:} The robot must point at the place or location in which the guest can sit.
