\chapter{General Rules \& Regulations}
\label{chap:rules}

These are the general rules and regulations for the competition in the RoboCup@Home league.
Every rule in this section can be considered to implicitly include the term \emph{\enquote{unless stated otherwise}}, meaning that additional or contrary rules in particular
test specifications have a higher priority than those mentioned herein in the general rules and regulations.

\section{Audience interaction}
Direct interaction with the audience is not a part of most challenges, though some explicitly require it in an effort to make robots step out of the laboratory.

Informing the audience however is important for the league.
