\subsection{Standard Platform Leagues}
RoboCup@Home features two Standard Platform Leagues adhering to the rules listed above.

\subsubsection{Modifications}
\label{rule:spl-mods}
Standardized platforms allow teams to compete in equality of conditions by eliminating all hardware-dependent variables.
Therefore, modifications and alterations to the robots are strictly forbidden; including, but not limited to attaching, connecting, plugging, gluing, and taping components into and onto the robot, as well as modifying or altering the robot structure.
Voiding this rule leads to immediate disqualification from the competition and penalty for the team (see~\refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}).

During the \iterm{Robot Inspection} test (see~\refsec{sec:robot_inspection}), the TC will verify that the robot is in proper state for the competition; presenting no alterations and a neat condition.
EC and TC members may request re-inspection of a SPL robot at any time during the competition.

\textbf{Clothing, coloring, and stickers:} Robots are allowed to \enquote{wear} clothes, as well as have stickers (e.g., a sticker exhibiting the logo of an sponsor).
Painting the robot with another color or design is also allowed. 
However, artificial markers (e.g. bar codes, QR codes, OpenCV markers) are strictly forbidden. 
Teams should contact the robot providet before altering the robot's appearance.
